## Overview
:tada: __Welcome to PyCourse__ :tada:  

This course is preapared for those who want to learn more about python and it's capablities.  
The main intention of this course is to give you a better intuition about python, how to better use it, write it and apply it.

### Course Road Map
> :black_nib: The full details of the contents are available [here](#contents).  

At the begining of the course, ___we review the basic topics of python___ such as variables, operations, primitive data types and etc.  
Second section is a dive into the ___Python's data structure___.
Then we will take a look at ___how to write python codes correctly___. That means the way most programmers do and the way that it is intended to be written.  
After that we will start the ___Programming paradigims___, First, functional programming, and later object oriented programming in python. We'll also spend some time reviewing other ways to write python code.

## Contents
The contents of this course are based on the books __Fluent Python - Luciano Ramalho__ and __Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Al Sweigart__.  
It is estimated that these contents take 16 to 20 hours to complete.
