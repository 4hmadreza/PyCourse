# :snake: Python: One Step Further 
One step further in python.  
Instructed by Alireza Khalilian.
## Overview
:snake: __Welcome to PyCourse, One Step Further__  

This course is preapared for those who want to learn more about python and it's capablities.  
The main intention of this course is to give you a better intuition about python, how to better use it, write it and apply it.  
> ⚠️ __Having prior basic knowledge about python is _mandetory___.  
> However, at the beginning of the course, we review the basics of python to refresh your memory on the subject.  

### Course Road Map
> :black_nib: The full details of the contents are available [here](#contents).  

At the begining of the course, ___we review the basic topics of python___ such as variables, operations, primitive data types and etc.  
Second section is a dive into the ___Python's data structure___.  
Then we will take a look at ___how to write python codes correctly___. That means the way most programmers do and the way that it is intended to be written.  
After that we will start the ___Programming paradigims___, First, _functional programming_, and later _object oriented programming_ in python. We'll also spend some time exploring other ways to write python code.  
Later, we learn how ___packages and modules___ are handled in python.  
And in the end, we learn some of the most important ___built in modules of python___.

> We intended to cover the python's built in GUI (called Tkinter) as well. However because of the time limitations at hand, it is removed from the contetns.

### Discussions and Issues  
Student's are free to use the __Issues__ and __Discussion__ section of the repository to ask questions and start disccusions.  

### Exercises
After the end of each topic, an __Exercise__ will be given to students. The details of these exercises are uploaded to this github repository. Each student will have a seperate branch to work on. The deadline of each exercise is determined by it's difficulity. It is worth to note that any commit to your branch after the specified deadline is not accaptable.  

### Notes
At the end of each week, the respective notes will be uploaded to this document. You can use these notes to review the lessons and solve the exercises. Feel free to explore them, review and update them.
